<h3>What is Pomodoro ?</h3>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking down work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros," after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used to track his work as a university student. The technique is intended to improve focus, motivation, and productivity by minimizing distractions and facilitating regular breaks.</p>
