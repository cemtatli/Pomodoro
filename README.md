<h1>:watch: Pomodoro</h1>
<p>Welcome to the "Pomodoro" repository</p>

<h3>What is Pomodoro ?</h3>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a method used as a time management technique. Developed by the Italian Francesco Cirillo, this technique aims to work more efficiently by dividing time into short working intervals.
The basic principle of the Pomodoro Technique is to set the working time to 25 minutes and only deal with one task during this time. All kinds of distractions should be avoided during this time. At the end of the 25-minute working period, a break is given. These breaks can last 5-10 minutes. By taking a short rest during this time, concentration is regained.</p>
